## Running the Password Generator

The password generator window will appear with the following elements:

- "Choose Length": Use the slider to select the desired length of the password.
- "Generate": Click this button to generate a random password based on the chosen length.
- "Copy": After generating a password, click this button to copy it to the clipboard.
